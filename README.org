* Overview
This repository will contain code that I write for Udacity CS 212: Design of Computer Programs. Small code snippets written for quizzes will usually not be included.

* Extras
For fun I started writing the poker game functions in Haskell and I will most likely to continue to write Haskell versions of code presented in the class.
